Acts As Immutable
=================

A Rails plugin that will ensure an ActiveRecord object is immutable once
saved. Optionally, you can specify attributes to be mutable if the object
is in a particular state (block evaluates to true).

Install
-------

script/plugin install git://github.com/pkieltyka/acts_as_immutable.git


Usage examples
--------------

# Ex. 1
# All attributes will be immutable
class PaymentTransaction < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_immutable
end


# Ex. 2
# All attributes will be immutable except 'paid',
# ie. if the invoice is still outstanding
class Invoice < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_immutable :paid do
		paid == false
	end
end


# Ex. 3
# Objects are immutable unless the subscription is
# active or free in which case changes can be made
# to: status, free and updated_at
class Subscription < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_immutable :status, :free, :updated_at do
		free? || active?
	end
		
	def active?
		status == "active"
	end
end

> sub = Subscription.new
> sub.status = "active"
> sub.free = false
> sub.start_date = Time.now
> sub.end_date = Time.now + 1.year
> sub.save
=> true

> sub.start_date = Time.now + 1.week
=> ActiveRecord::ActsAsImmutableError: start_date is an immutable attribute

> sub.update_attributes({ :start_date => Time.now + 1.week })
=> ActiveRecord::ActsAsImmutableError: start_date is an immutable attribute

> sub.status = "cancelled"
> sub.save
=> true
